/**
 * Lets the calling agent (or its user) file feedback about this MCP server into
 * Sentry User Feedback, linked to the active trace. Registered only when the
 * hosting entry point runs with Sentry (`ServerConfig.enableFeedbackTool`) —
 * without an initialized SDK the feedback would go nowhere, so the tool is
 * hidden rather than silently dropping submissions.
 *
 * The message is untrusted caller input: it is bounded by the schema and passed
 * to Sentry as data, never interpreted. `Sentry.captureFeedback` produces `type:
 * "feedback"` events, which never reach `beforeSend`/`beforeSendTransaction` — so
 * the privacy guardrail is attached directly to this call's scope instead.
